# RemainderSorting
From hackerrank

Implement a function that receives an array of strings and sorts them based on the following heuristics:
- The promary sort is by increising remainder of the strings lengths, modulo 3
- If multiple strings have the same remainder, they should be sorted in alphabetical order
